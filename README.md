## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### 📝 Registration
- User signs up using email & password  
- Supabase handles verification  
- User metadata is stored securely  
- Admin role is determined internally (email-based)  

### 🔑 Login
- Email + password authentication  
- Session persists across app restarts  
- Admin users are redirected to the admin dashboard  

### 🔄 Forgot Password
- User enters email  
- Supabase sends password reset email  
- Secure OTP-based reset flow  

---

## 🛠️ Repair Booking Flow
1. User submits a repair request  
2. Status defaults to **Received**  
3. Request appears instantly on admin dashboard  
4. Admin updates repair stages:
   - Received  
   - Diagnosing  
   - Repairing  
   - Repaired  
   - Completed  
5. User sees real-time updates  
6. Completed or cancelled requests move to history automatically
